Hello! This is: how i used my wii u for an assignment. <br />
Well, you may be wondering, so i will explain it now <br />
I had an assignment where I had to make a "Con" for a book we were reading. I thought that the wara wara plaza was a graet fit!<br />
So I decided to get working on the Wara Wara Plaza <br />
(heres how: <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/i-permanently-gave-wara-wara-plaza-life-again-injected-it-full-of-my-personality-and-you-can-too.562257/">this!)</a> <br />

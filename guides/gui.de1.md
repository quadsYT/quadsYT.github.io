### Hello! Today I will be teaching you how to use smash ultimate (switch) mods. First you need a Atmosphere Modded Switch. No emulator. <br />
First you will need these: <a href="https://gamebanana.com/tools/6865">Mod Manager </a> and <a href="https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/">Mod Loader </a> <br />
Extact the mod manager and mod loader to the root of the sd card (the main page, not in any folder or file) <br />
Alright, now you will get mods on <a href="https://gamebanana.com/games/6498">get mods here </a>. <br />
## Possible Ways the mod is layed out:
### So, open it and you might have these ways of how the files is organized:
Either you have multiple folders, so create a folder for your mod and throw all the multiple folders in the new folder you created, now you can skip to line 13 <br />
Or, if you have a folder that says your mod, your good. Skip to line 13 <br />
And even, you might have a folder thats like "fighter" but it isnt your mod name. Create a folder and put the other folders thats there into your new folder. <br />
(Line 11) Now, you want to make a folder named "switch" and inside of it "mods" now throw your mod folders into that. <br /> 
Now while on CFW, hold R while booting smash. Select "Arcadia" and select your mods, and then hit X to launch Smash. Select your user profile. Yes I am aware it takes forever to boot, but when you finally play, it is very fun. <br />
That is my tutorial on: How to mod smash! <br />
Now remember, go eat tide pods /s <br />

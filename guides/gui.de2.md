To get started, open up safari. Now, input the website itest.nz into safari. <br />
In the middle-bottom part of your screen, click the box with an arrow key pointing up and scroll down and hit "Add to Home Screen" <br />
Name it whatever you want, I named it "Samsung Phone Review" and added it via hitting the "Add" button on the top right <br />
Quit to your home screen, and open it. <br />
Now when it asks you to hit next, hit it. You may wanna wait. Now you can review Samsung's iPhone test <br />
